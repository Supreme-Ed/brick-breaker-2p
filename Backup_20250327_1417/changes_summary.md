# Changes Summary - 2025-03-27 (Approx. 1:45 PM - 2:26 PM ET)

This session focused on adding mouse control as an option for Player 1 in the Single Player mode of the Brick Breaker game.

## Key Changes:

1.  **Control Selection UI (`index.html`):**
    *   Added radio buttons ("Keyboard" / "Mouse") to the main menu, allowing users to select the control method for Player 1 specifically when choosing "Single Player" mode.
    *   Updated the controls description text to reflect the new mouse control option.
    *   Modified the `startGame` JavaScript function to read the selected control method and pass it as a `control` URL parameter (e.g., `&control=mouse`) when navigating to `brick-breaker.html` for Single Player mode.

2.  **Game Logic (`brick-breaker.html`):**
    *   Added a global variable `player1ControlMethod` to store the chosen control method ('keyboard' or 'mouse'), defaulting to 'keyboard'.
    *   Updated the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to read the `control` URL parameter passed from `index.html` and set the `player1ControlMethod` variable accordingly.
    *   Added a `mousemove` event listener to the game canvas.
    *   Created a `handleMouseMove` function that:
        *   Checks if the game is in Single Player mode (`gameMode === 1`) and if mouse control is selected (`player1ControlMethod === 'mouse'`).
        *   Updates `paddle1.x` based on the mouse's horizontal position relative to the canvas, centering the paddle under the cursor.
        *   Includes checks to prevent movement if the paddle is frozen or turned to ashes.
        *   Clamps the paddle's position within the canvas boundaries.
    *   Modified the `movePaddles` function:
        *   The existing keyboard logic (Arrow keys) for Player 1 is now only applied if `player1ControlMethod === 'keyboard'`.
        *   If mouse control is active, `paddle1.dx` is reset to 0 within this function (as position is set directly by the mouse handler).
    *   Added a `mousedown` event listener to the game canvas.
    *   Created a `handleMouseDown` function that:
        *   Checks if the game is in Single Player mode, mouse control is selected, and the left mouse button (`e.button === 0`) was clicked.
        *   If conditions are met, it activates the available power-up (Laser first, then Freeze Ray), replicating the logic previously tied only to the Space key.
