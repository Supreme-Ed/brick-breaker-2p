# Audio System Debug Log (DEBUG-AudioFix.md)

This log tracks the attempts made to fix the audio system issues, particularly the widespread failure after the `.wav` file rework and the specific `uiClick` problem.

## Attempt 1: Fix Core Initialization Timing

*   **Date:** 2025-04-04
*   **Result:** **Failed.** Introduced `TypeError: this.init is not a function`.

## Attempt 2: Remove Lingering `init()` Call

*   **Date:** 2025-04-04
*   **Result:** **Failed.** Console still shows `Cannot play sound '...'. Audio system not initialized`.

## Attempt 3: Consolidate AudioManager Instance

*   **Date:** 2025-04-04
*   **Action:** Modified `menu.js`, `main.js`, `input.js` to import and use the `audioManager` singleton consistently.
*   **Expected Result:** Single instance used everywhere, sounds work.
*   **Actual Result:** **Failed.** Logs showed successful initialization on `index.html` (menu) context, but errors (`isInitialized: false`) persisted on `game.html` (gameplay) context. Root cause identified: Navigating between HTML pages resets the JS context, creating a new, uninitialized `audioManager` singleton instance for `game.html`.

## Attempt 4: Initialize Audio Explicitly in Game Context

*   **Date:** 2025-04-04
*   **Problem Observed:** The `audioManager` instance used by `game.html` is never initialized because the required user interaction happened on the previous page (`index.html`).
*   **Action:**
    1.  Modified `game.js` `init` method to explicitly call and `await audioManager.tryResumeContext();` near the beginning.
    2.  Removed the redundant `initialInteractionOccurred` flag and the `tryResumeContext` calls from the interaction handlers in `input.js`.
*   **Expected Result:** The `audioManager` instance specific to `game.html` will be correctly initialized when the game starts. All sounds (menu and game) should work reliably.
*   **Actual Result:** **Success!** User confirmed that all sounds (menu clicks, gameplay sounds, pause clicks) work correctly after these changes. No console errors reported.
