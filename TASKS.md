- [ ] Verify scoring implementation matches PRD specifications

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Implement basic game mechanics
- [x] Create multiple brick patterns
- [x] Add power-up system
- [x] Implement AI opponent
- [x] Add touch controls
- [x] Set up testing infrastructure
- [x] Fix power-up activation issues with keyboard controls
- [x] Improve power-up system reliability during extended gameplay

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] Make start screen look better
- [ ] Rework sound system to support sound files for game sounds
- [ ] Add screen size check and associated adjustments for different screen sizes and platforms
- [ ] Add particle effects when bricks are broken
- [ ] Implement difficulty levels for AI
- [ ] Add visual effects for power-ups and brick destruction
- [ ] Create a proper game over screen

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add support for Bluetooth controllers
- [ ] Add local high score tracking
- [ ] Implement additional power-ups
- [ ] Create additional brick patterns
- [ ] Add customization options for paddles and balls

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add online multiplayer capability
- [ ] Implement user accounts and global leaderboards
- [ ] Create a level editor
- [ ] Add achievements system

## Bug Fixes

- [x] Fix keyboard power-up activation (spacebar and 's' key) issues
- [x] Resolve power-up visual and functional failures during extended gameplay
- [ ] Address TypeScript "possibly null" warnings
- [ ] Ensure consistent game performance across different devices
- [ ] Fix any touch control issues on mobile devices

## Notes

- The "possibly null" TypeScript warnings should be addressed using best practices (optional chaining, nullish coalescing, or explicit null checks) rather than using non-null assertions.
- When implementing new features, follow the existing code patterns and architecture.
- All new features should include appropriate tests.
